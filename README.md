# 🌐 shreyas' homepage
I used to have a static site I [cobbled together in undergrad](https://github.com/ssuds/ssuds.github.io/commit/2121a9e20e38f9f0b9760d2bcee50d3978f0897e) with Jekyll and Bootstrap and lots of duct tape. I was particularly proud of the cool video montage on the homepage. But it was stale and hard to update. And now there are great designers with great templates! I'm starting over from scratch with [Spikeysanju](https://github.com/Spikeysanju/sanju.sh)'s [astro](https://astro.build/) theme.

The template was under the Apache License 2.0 so I'm just keeping that way! If you want to make a copy, you should probably just start with Sanju's template, though.
