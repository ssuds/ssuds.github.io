    			<h1>Dragon Capsule Platform</h1>
				<h3>One of the projects I worked on at SpaceX was designing a platform allowing for technician access during the spacecraft build process. This project was initially intended for one particular workstation, but it was designed with versatility in mind. The design was a resounding success, and was expanded to usage in almost every stage of the capsule build process.</h3>
				<h2>Unexpected Application</h2>
				<h3>While the platform was designed as a practical tool for assembly technicians, it also functioned well as a runway for supermodel Karlie Kloss! <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/model-karlie-kloss-takes-off-1448295895">(WSJ December 2015)</a> It's great to see this project serving a double purpose by inspiring women in STEM.</h3>
