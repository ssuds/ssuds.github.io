    			<h1>FSAE Engine Transition</h1>
				<h3>The Illini Motorsports Formula SAE team had used the Honda CBR 600 F4i engine as its powerplant for over a decade. Prior to that, the CBR 600 F4 (the carbureted ancestor to the F4i) was used for many years. The engine proved to be a reliable and trustworthy choice, but was beginning to show its age in many aspects.</h3>
				<h2>The Solution</h2>
				<h3>After a significant amount of deliberation, the current generation Yamaha YZF-R6 engine was selected as the replacement for the F4i. This marked one of the largest changes to the vehicle's design in recent memory, and I was responsible for leading the integration of this new platform.</h3>
