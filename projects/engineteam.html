    			<h1>FSAE Engine Transition</h1>
				<h3>The Illini Motorsports Formula SAE team had used the Honda CBR 600 F4i engine as its powerplant for over a decade. Prior to that, the CBR 600 F4 (the carbureted ancestor to the F4i) was used for many years. The Honda engine was beginning to show its age in many aspects. It was elected to upgrade to the modern Yamaha YZF-R6 engine.</h3>

				<h2>A Multifaceted Problem</h2>
				<h3>This change marked one of the largest changes to the vehicle's design in recent memory, and I was responsible for all aspects of the transition. A new engine package not only requires mechanical integration, but also hundreds of hours of calibration, testing and validation. Almost every engine system component required some sort of modification to support the R6 powertrain.</h3>

				<h2>Hard Work Pays Off</h2>
				<h3>The change proved to be enormously successful, resulting in one of the best competition seasons in team history. All design targets were met, with a noticeable increase in peak power. The vehicle completed the endurance event at all competitions attended, proving the reliability of the system. Engine performance was clearly demonstrated, with a 6th place autocross finish out of 115 cars at Formula SAE Michigan and a 3rd place autocross finish out of 80 cars at Formula SAE Lincoln.</h3>
