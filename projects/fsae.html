	 	<h1>Formula SAE
			<small>I've worked on quite a few manufacturing, design and testing projects during my 4 years on Formula SAE. This page highlights some of the projects I've worked on. As my Senior Design capstone project, I'm currently leading the team in its <a href="/projects/engineteam">transition to a new engine</a>.</small>

				<h3>Dynamometer Engine Stand</h3>
				<p>I manufactured an engine stand which fixtured our new Yamaha R6 engine in the dynamometer for calibrations.</p>			
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-4 col-xs-12">
				<img src="/img/fuelsystem.jpg" class="img-responsive img-rounded" alt="R6 Fuel System">
				<h3>R6 Fuel System</h3>
				<p>I specified and implemented a custom return style fuel system which would meet fuel delivery requirements for the new Yamaha engine. This also included a new fuel cell within the dynamometer.</p>

				<img src="/img/silencer.jpg" class="img-responsive img-rounded" alt="Exhaust Silencer">
				<h3>Engine Silencer</h3>
				<p>I designed and manufactured an innovative exhaust silencer to meet Formula SAE sound testing requirements. The design was improved through multiple iterations and performed flawlessly at competition.</p>

				<img src="/img/drysump.png" class="img-responsive img-rounded" alt="Dry Sump Reservoir design">
				<h3>Dry Sump Reservoir</h3>
				<p>I led a redesign of the Dry Sump reservoir, which had been newly implemented the previous year. I also forged new manufacturing partnerships to produce the component. The new design provided more consistent lubrication as opposed to the previous design.</p>

				<img src="/img/enginerebuild.jpg" class="img-responsive img-rounded" alt="Rebuilt Race Engine">
				<h3>Engine Rebuilds</h3>
				<p>I assisted in complete engine rebuilds for use in our racecar. This included teardown, sizing of bearings and other wear items, and full reassembly to specification.</p>

				<h3>Computational Fluid Dynamics</h3>
				<p>While most of my work has involved the engine system, I've also worked on some projects with other subsystems. For example, I ran CFD simulation using Star-CCM+ to assist the Aerodynamics team in diffuser design trade studies. I've also worked to start a simulations group within engine team, focused on validation of components critical to airflow.</p>

				<h3>Suspension Toe & Camber Brackets</h3>
				<p>I've worked on various machining projects with other subsystems. For example, I helped manufacture suspension Toe and Camber brackets using a Bridgeport vertical mill.</p>
