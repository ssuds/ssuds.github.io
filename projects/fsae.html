	 	<h1>Formula SAE
			<small>I've worked on quite a few manufacturing, design and testing projects during my 4 years on Formula SAE. This page highlights some of the projects I've worked on. As my Senior Design capstone project, I successfully led the team in its <a href="/projects/engineteam">transition to a new engine</a>.<small><strong><i> Hover over the images to learn more.</i></strong></small></small>

						<div class="overlay">
							<h3>Driveshaft Safety Cage</h3>
							<p>This safety cage was fabricated to constrain the driveshaft coupling our engine to the dynamometer in case of failure. It was cut with an Oxy-Acetylene torch and TIG welded.</p>

						<h3>Dynamometer Engine Stand</h3>
						<p>I manufactured an engine stand which fixtures our new Yamaha R6 engine in the dynamometer for calibrations. Proper jigging and dimensional accuracy was critical to minimize misalignment of the output shaft.</p>

					<div class="overlay">
						<h3>PCB Design</h3>
						<p>I designed multiple PCBs in EAGLE for vehicle and testing use. I redesigned the vehicle's gear control module, transitioning from a PIC18 to a PIC32 microcontroller and implementing additional I/O for more robust paddle shifting functionality. Additionally, I designed a board to break out the engine control unit wiring harness for diagnostics and developmental wiring changes.</p>

						<h3>R6 Fuel System</h3>
						<p>I specified and implemented a brand new return style fuel system which would meet fuel delivery requirements for the new Yamaha engine. This included appropriate injector and regulator sizing, sensor selection, and a more robust fuel system in the dynamometer.</p>

						<h3>Engine Silencer</h3>
						<p>I designed and manufactured an innovative exhaust silencer to meet Formula SAE sound testing requirements. The design was improved through multiple iterations and performed well below the maximum sound level.</p>

						<h3>Dry Sump Reservoir</h3>
						<p>I led a redesign of the Dry Sump reservoir, which had been newly implemented in the previous year. I also forged new manufacturing partnerships to produce the component. The new design provided more consistent lubrication as opposed to the previous design.</p>

						<h3>Engine Rebuilds</h3>
						<p>I assisted in complete engine rebuilds for use in our racecar. This included teardown, sizing of bearings and other wear items, and full reassembly to specification.</p>

						<h3>Computational Fluid Dynamics</h3>
						<p>While most of my work has involved the engine system, I've also worked on some projects with other subsystems. For example, I ran CFD simulation using Star-CCM+ to assist the Aerodynamics team in diffuser design trade studies. I've also worked to start a simulations group within engine team, focused on validation of components critical to airflow.</p>

						<h3>Suspension Toe & Camber Brackets</h3>
						<p>I've worked on various machining projects with other subsystems. For example, I helped manufacture suspension Toe and Camber brackets using a Bridgeport vertical mill.</p>

						<h3>Gas Pedal</h3>
						<p>The gas pedal for our car was manufactured from carbon composite with aluminum and bronze bushings to pivot about. I also updated the design to integrate an accelerator pedal position sensor, accomodating a transition to electronic throttle control.</p>
