							<h3>Driveshaft Safety Cage</h3>
							<p>This safety cage was fabricated to constrain the driveshaft coupling our engine to the dynamometer in case of failure. It was cut with an Oxy-Acetylene torch and TIG welded.</p>

						<h3>PCB Design</h3>
						<p>I designed multiple PCBs in EAGLE for vehicle and testing use. I redesigned the vehicle's gear control module, transitioning from a PIC18 to a PIC32 microcontroller and implementing additional I/O for more robust paddle shifting functionality. Additionally, I designed a board to break out the engine control unit wiring harness for diagnostics and developmental wiring changes.</p>

						<h3>R6 Fuel System</h3>
						<p>I specified and implemented a brand new return style fuel system which would meet fuel delivery requirements for the new Yamaha engine. This included appropriate injector and regulator sizing, sensor selection, and a more robust fuel system in the dynamometer.</p>

For example, I ran CFD simulation using Star-CCM+ to assist the Aerodynamics team in diffuser design trade studies. I've also worked to start a simulations group within engine team, focused on validation of components critical to airflow.</p>

    			<h1>A new foundation</h1>
				<h3>As my Senior Design capstone project, I successfully led the team in its transition to a new engine, marking one of the largest powertrain changes in team history. The team had used the Honda CBR 600 F4i engine as its powerplant for over a decade, and even prior to that, its carbureted ancestor had been used. Between dwindling parts supply and reliability concerns, the Honda engine was beginning to show its age. After much careful deliberation, it was elected to upgrade to the modern Yamaha YZF-R6 engine.</h3>
			</div>
			<div class="grid-item">
				<h1>A complex problem</h1>
				<h3>This change marked one of the largest changes to the vehicle's design in recent memory, and I was responsible for all aspects of the transition. The new engine package required not only mechanical integration, but also hundreds of hours of calibration, testing and validation. Almost every engine system component required some sort of modification to support the R6 powertrain.</h3>
			</div>
			<div class="grid-item">
				<h1>Hard work pays off</h1>
				<h3>The change proved to be enormously successful, resulting in one of the best competition seasons in team history. All design targets were met, with a noticeable increase in peak power. The new system was judged as one of the best designed powertrains at competition, even when competing against teams that had many years of development in their calibration and components. The vehicle completed the endurance event at all competitions attended, proving the reliability of the system. Engine performance was clearly demonstrated, with a 6th place autocross finish out of 115 cars at Formula SAE Michigan and a 3rd place autocross finish out of 80 cars at Formula SAE Lincoln.</h3>
