				<h3>While my passion is on the mechanical side, I have worked on some software projects in my spare time.</h3>
				<h2>Web Development</h2>
				<h3>This website was made from scratch using the Bootstrap framework and Jekyll. The code is <a href="https://github.com/ssuds/ssuds.github.io">hosted on Github</a> and deployed using Github Pages</a>.</h3>
				<h2>Formula SAE</h2>
				<h3>I helped implement the new <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence">Confluence</a> powered Illini Motorsports Wiki, which acts as a central hub for team documentation, and serve as an administrator for the space. Additionally, I have contributed some <a href="https://github.com/nickofbh/veloce/commits/master">code</a> for the <a href="http://motorsports.illinois.edu/">team website</a>.
				<br><br>
				I've been able to use these strategies to improve development of Engine Calibrations. I built a new version control system which uses Git for calibration files and documents changes on the team wiki.

				<h2>Android</h2>
				<h3>For some time, I compiled the Cyanogenmod operating system for the Motorola Atrix HD. These unofficial builds were downloaded by nearly 3000 people.</h3>
