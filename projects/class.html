				<h3>Water Pump</h3>
				<p>This project's objective was to develop a mechanism converting rotary motion into linear motion, allowing an AC motor rotating at 120 RPM to power a small water pump. The device was able to pump water at 2.2 Gallons per Minute, making it one of the few entries to exceed the project requirement and winning 3rd place out of over 20 teams in Mechanical Design I (ME 370).</p>

				<h3>Motivational Ankle Strengthening System</h3>
				<p>The Motivational Ankle Strengthening System ("MASS" for short) was developed through the Design for Manufacturability (ME 350) class. The system allows for adjustable tension in two axes to allow patients with ankle injuries to progress through a strengthening program. Additionally, an Arduino interprets motion from these axes as a computer joystick input, letting the patient play interactive games through their rehabilitation.</p>

				<h3>Welded Model Car</h3>
				<p>This was manufactured as the final project for the Metallurgy and Welding Process (TSM 233) course. The model was TIG welded and powdercoated, and designed to potentially accomodate an RC car powertrain.</p>
