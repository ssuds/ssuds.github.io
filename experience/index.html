      	Intern in Product Excellence group specialized in Chassis Systems. Specific focus areas were Electronic Air Suspension system and torque management. <br> <br> Led quality initiatives to reduce manufacturing risk and increase robustness of Model S air suspension system. Successfully eliminated a top suspension issue, reducing factory issues per vehicle (IPV). Implemented changes led to a significant decrease in FMEA RPN. Helped build framework for Tesla's torque management strategy, including the rollout of a centralized controlled database. Conducted full torque audit of General Assembly production lines confirming design specifications were adhered to during manufacturing. Gained consensus of Chassis design team for new torque database, which was incorporated into Vehicle Inspection Standard.

      Production Intern in Composites Process Engineering group, responsible for all composite components on Falcon and Dragon vehicles. Overall focus was transitioning composite part production from small quantity to volume production, supporting a company-wide takt goal. <br> <br> Analyzed part data to validate new tooling designs and capital equipment purchasing. Developed and deployed a web app to provide live status on part and tool data, allowing engineers to easily track information needed to meet rate targets. Collaborated with vendors to procure equipment that would allow for rate production without sacrificing part quality. Supported day-to-day production activities, and validated new processes to simplify manufacturing of composite parts.
