I'm a founder, mechanical engineer, and [licensed California HVAC contractor](https://vayu.pro/?utm_source=shreyassudhakar.com).

I write a lot [about heat pumps](https://www.heatpumped.org/subscribe?utm_source=shreyassudhakar.com), the most efficient way to heat and cool buildings.

Previously, I built a tech-enabled heat pump company and went through Y Combinator. 

Before that, I was a rocket engineer and worked at companies like SpaceX, Blue Origin, and ABL Space Systems. 

I also built some really cool racecars in college! Plus robots and rockets in high school. I enjoy building things with my hands, and I don't mind getting dirty.

You can find me on [linkedin](http://linkedin.com/in/shreyassudhakar/) and [bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/shreyassudhakar.com). I reply to [every newsletter subscriber](https://www.heatpumped.org/subscribe?utm_source=shreyassudhakar.com) that emails me. And if you're in California and shopping for a new furnace, AC, or heat pump, I'd [love to help](https://cal.com/shreyassudhakar/heat-pump-consultation)!
