			<h1>About Me</h1> <br> <br>
				<p>

				I've had the opportunity to apply my skills in <a href="/experience">very diverse roles</a> ranging from research and development for electrical systems and large construction equipment to the production and testing of complex aerospace structures and propulsion systems. <br> <br>

				This exposure allows me to approach engineering problems with a full understanding of the entire product lifecycle: initial concept generation, manufacturing of a finished product, optimizations after product release and everything in between. As all the companies I've worked for have had on-site manufacturing capacity, I understand exactly how CAD models translate into an actual product.  <br> <br>

				Currently, I'm working at Blue Origin developing the engines to land the first woman and next man on the moon. <br> <br>

				I'm always <a href="/contact">open to new opportunities</a> allowing me to apply my skills to make a real impact on a product, process, or society as a whole.
