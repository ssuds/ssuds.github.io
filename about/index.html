			<h1>About Me</h1> <br> <br>
				<p>

				I recently graduated with a bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and am currently pursuing my master's degree in Aeronautics and Astronautics at the University of Washington. <br> <br>

				On campus at Illinois, I was heavily involved with the school's <a href="/projects/fsae">Formula SAE team</a>, Illini Motorsports. Through my time on the team, I grew from a new recruit into the engine team leader, coordinating a full redesign of the vehicle's engine package.<br> <br> 

				Outside of school, I've had the opportunity to apply my skills in <a href="/experience">very diverse roles</a> ranging from research and development for electrical systems and large construction equipment to the production and testing of complex aerospace structures and propulsion systems. This exposure allows me to approach engineering problems with a full understanding of the entire product lifecycle: initial concept generation, manufacturing of a finished product, optimizations after product release and everything in between. As all the companies I've worked for have had on-site manufacturing capacity, I understand exactly how CAD models translate into an actual product.  <br> <br>

				I'm always <a href="/contact">open to new opportunities</a> allowing me to apply my skills to make a real impact on a product, process, or society as a whole.
