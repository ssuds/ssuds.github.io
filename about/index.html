			<h1>About Me</h1> <br> <br>
				<p>

				I'm currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, graduating in 2017. <br> <br>

				On campus, I'm heavily involved with our school's <a href="/projects/fsae">Formula SAE team</a>, Illini Motorsports. Through my time on the team, I've been able to grow from a new recruit into the engine team leader. This year, I'm responsible for coordinating a <a href="/projects/engineteam">full redesign of our vehicle's engine package.</a>  <br> <br> 

				Outside of school, I've had the opportunity to apply my skills in <a href="/experience">very diverse roles</a> ranging from research and development for electrical systems and large construction equipment to the production of complex aerospace structures. This exposure allows me to approach engineering problems with a full understanding of the entire product lifecycle: initial concept generation, manufacturing of a finished product, optimizations after product release and everything in between. As all the companies I've worked for have had on-site manufacturing capacity, I understand exactly how CAD models translate into an actual product.  <br> <br>

				I'm always <a href="/contact">open to new opportunities</a> allowing me to apply my skills to make a real impact on a product, process, or society as a whole.
